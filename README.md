 Project Description: Bank Customer Market Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning
This project focuses on applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment a bankâ€™s customer base into distinct groups based on their financial behavior and usage patterns. By leveraging clustering algorithms like K-Means, we aim to uncover natural groupings among customers without any prior labels or classifications.

The dataset includes various customer features such as account balance, purchase types, payment history, and credit limits. These variables are used to identify patterns and similarities in customer behavior.

Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and clustering, customers are grouped into segments such as high-value customers, frequent installment payers, or low-engagement users. These insights enable the bank to better understand customer needs and tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service efforts to each segment.

Ultimately, this project provides a data-driven approach to customer segmentation, which can improve customer satisfaction, enhance product targeting, and drive business growth for the bank.
